# Create pretty [cucumber-jvm](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm) Reports everywhere

This is a small Jar library that enables you to easily create pretty html reports of cucumber-jvm. This libary can then be used to build
plugins for Jenkins, Maven or whatever you like.

## Background 
The code has been extracted from [jenkins-cucumber-jvm-reports-plugin-java](https://github.com/masterthought/jenkins-cucumber-jvm-reports-plugin-java).
Yet there it was bundled for Jenkins only. This project aims at providing the basis for different kinds of plugins.
